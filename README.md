Hi, I’m @LimaJuliett! I don't have much experience with GitHub or coding in general, but I'm excited to learn more!
I'm strongest in Java/Javascript (although I'm not particularly good at either), and I also do a lot with the Arduino IDE.
Even though I'm not a great programmer, I enjoy contributing to open-source when and how I can, so I hope to see you around!
